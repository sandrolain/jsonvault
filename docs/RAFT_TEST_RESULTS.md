# JsonVault Raft Cluster Test Results

## Test Environment

- **Date**: July 5, 2025
- **Docker Compose**: `deployment/docker-compose-raft.yml`
- **Nodes**: 3 containers (jsonvault-node1, jsonvault-node2, jsonvault-node3)
- **Ports**: 8080, 8081, 8082

## Container Status

All three JsonVault containers successfully started and are reporting healthy status:

```
NAME              STATUS                    PORTS
jsonvault-node1   Up (healthy)              0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
jsonvault-node2   Up (healthy)              0.0.0.0:8081->8080/tcp  
jsonvault-node3   Up (healthy)              0.0.0.0:8082->8080/tcp
```

## TCP Protocol Verification

### ‚úÖ Working Features

1. **Individual Node Communication**
   - TCP connections work on all ports
   - JSON protocol correctly implemented
   - Length-prefixed message format works

2. **Database Operations on Single Nodes**
   - `SET` operations succeed: `{"Ok":null}`
   - `GET` operations return stored data correctly
   - `PING/PONG` health checks work
   - `DELETE` operations function properly

3. **JSONPath Queries**
   - Complex JSON storage and retrieval works
   - JSONPath expressions correctly executed: `$.users[*].name` ‚Üí `["Alice","Bob"]`
   - Query results properly formatted

4. **Error Handling**
   - Non-existent keys return: `{"Ok":null}`
   - Invalid queries return appropriate errors

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

1. **No Raft Replication**
   - Data written to Node 1 is NOT available on Node 2 or Node 3
   - Each node operates with its own independent in-memory database
   - No leader election implemented
   - No inter-node communication

2. **Independent Node Operation**
   - Each container runs as a standalone JsonVault instance
   - No cluster formation or consensus
   - No data synchronization between nodes

## Test Results Summary

### Functional Tests

| Test | Node 1 | Node 2 | Node 3 | Status |
|------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| PING | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | All responding |
| SET | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Individual writes work |
| GET (same node) | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Local reads work |
| GET (cross-node) | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | No replication |
| JSONPath | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Queries work locally |

### Example Commands Tested

```bash
# PING test
echo '"Ping"' ‚Üí "Pong"

# SET operation  
echo '{"Set":{"key":"test","value":"hello"}}' ‚Üí {"Ok":null}

# GET operation (same node)
echo '{"Get":{"key":"test"}}' ‚Üí {"Ok":"hello"}

# GET operation (different node)  
echo '{"Get":{"key":"test"}}' ‚Üí {"Ok":null}

# JSONPath query
echo '{"QGet":{"key":"data","query":"$.users[*].name"}}' ‚Üí {"Ok":["Alice","Bob"]}
```

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

- TCP server with length-prefixed JSON protocol
- JSON database with in-memory storage
- JSONPath query support using jq
- Basic CRUD operations (SET, GET, DELETE)
- Advanced operations (QGET, QSET, MERGE)
- Docker containerization
- Health checks and monitoring
- Multi-node deployment via Docker Compose

### üöß Partial Implementation

- Raft consensus framework (structure exists, not fully connected)
- Node ID generation and cluster configuration
- RaftManager initialization (single-node mode)

### ‚ùå Missing for Full Raft Implementation

- Inter-node communication channels
- Leader election protocol
- Log replication mechanism
- Consensus algorithm for write operations
- Cluster membership management
- Network partitioning handling
- Persistent storage integration

## Scripts Provided

1. **`test-current-implementation.sh`** - Comprehensive test showing current functionality
2. **`test-tcp-protocol.sh`** - Basic TCP protocol verification  
3. **`test-raft-cluster.sh`** - Full cluster test suite (ready for when Raft is complete)

## Next Steps for Full Raft Implementation

1. **Inter-node Communication**
   - Implement network layer for Raft RPC calls
   - Add cluster discovery mechanism
   - Configure peer-to-peer connections

2. **Leader Election**
   - Implement RequestVote RPC
   - Add election timeout and voting logic
   - Handle split votes and re-elections

3. **Log Replication**
   - Implement AppendEntries RPC
   - Add log consistency checks
   - Handle log conflicts and repairs

4. **Consensus Integration**
   - Route write operations through leader
   - Ensure linearizable consistency
   - Add persistence for Raft state

## Conclusion

The JsonVault project successfully demonstrates a working JSON database with TCP protocol and advanced querying capabilities. The Docker Compose setup correctly deploys multiple nodes and the communication protocol is fully functional.

While Raft consensus is not yet fully implemented for data replication, the foundation is solid and the codebase is well-structured for completing the distributed consensus features.

The verification scripts confirm that all basic database operations work correctly and the system is ready for the next phase of Raft implementation.
